I'm not making much progress coding and listening.

but I really like listening.

I need to practice thinking "out loud", so to speak.

So, for now, I'm okay with the fact that I'm not getting much done.

In fact, I'm going to just listen and clean for a bit.

I'm going to be happy with my hour as long as I am sorting. I don't care what. If I don't get a lot of active development done, that's okay. I'll get there.
